                            My name is Mads Falkenberg SÃ¸nderstrup, I'm { this.getAge() } years old and from Denmark!
                            <br/>
                            Since I was a little kid I've wanted to work with <b>IT</b> and when I became a teenager,
                            <b> programming</b> was the main draw as I taught myself at the age of 13 to work not just with
                            <b> Lua</b>, but also <b>SQL</b> and later <b>Java</b> before attending a formal class where
                            I primarily worked with <b>C#</b> to get my Professions Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.<br/>
                            Following since I've worked with more languages and various technologies, as I am attending the
                            IT University of Copenhagen to get my Master's Degree in <b>Games</b>, expected graduation by August 2019.
                            What isn't listed below can be found in the printable Resume on the right.<br/><br/>
                            I can always be reached by <a href={'mailto:xenon373@gmail.com'}>email</a> or LinkedIn/Twitter,
                            which can be seen on the left in the menu or at the top of all pages for further questions or interest.
